# Bake

### Description
This app fetches and parses JSON from a websource, and displays that data to the end-user as a cookbook of recipes.

This project was built for the Udacity Android Developer nanodegree.


### What I accomplished in this project:

* Parsed JSON from a websource to generate Recipe objects.
* Displayed the details of those recipes, including ingredients, and text/video instructions.
* Implemented ExoPlayer to display video from the internet to the user for each step in the recipe.
* Provided swipe capabilities using ViewPager.
* Designed a layout that dynamically adjusts based on device screen size and orientation.
* Created a widget to display the ingredients for a selected recipe on the homescreen, for ease of grocery shopping.
